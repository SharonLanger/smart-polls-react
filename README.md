# Smart-polls-react

This project is the UI of smart-polling.
Clone the repository and run it on your preferred IDE after connecting it to the backend.

### Connecting to smart-polls-backend:
In the file 'properties.js' fill in the url to the backend
- property: backend_url_base='{smart-polls-backend-url}'

### Note: 
you might need to import packages used before running the UI. 
NPM will do it just fine.
